Notes of reading _嵌入式实时操作系统 μC/OS-II 教程 (第二版)_ by _程文娟、吴永忠、苗刚中_. I have been curious for a long time about the differences between embedded operating systems and general OS like Linux. Since I have understood how Linux works on a high level (very very high and abstract 😅), I'm turning to embedded RTOS now.

Move on! 😈
